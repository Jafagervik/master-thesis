\chapter{Discussion}
\label{chap:disc}

This sixth chapter analyzes the results presented in Chapter \ref{chap:results} and further examines the programs detailed in Chapter \ref{chap:exp}. We explore the overall design, strengths, and current limitations of both \texttt{Judas} and \texttt{TinyDAS}. The chapter concludes with an evaluation of Julia as a programming language for data science and \acrshort{ai} applications.
