Digital signal processing has over the last 100 years gone from almost non-existent to utmost critical importance. By processing signal data, one can get access to all kinds of information, music, movement and locations. By creating models to analyze and interpret these  \\

\acrfull{das} is a rather new technology that allows for real-time analysis over fiber-optical cables, and gives us highly accurate senor data to work with. 

Previous work on this data (see \cite{projthesis}) revolved around processing \acrshort{hdf5} files as fast and efficient as possible, trying to parallellize already existent code, and take advantage of newer technologies, such as Julia.

As mentioned in \cite{projthesis}, Julia has packages for working with \acrshort{ai} and \acrshort{ml}.
