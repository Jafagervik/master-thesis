%\subsection{Did we reach our goals?}


\textbf{G1: Evaluate the effectiveness in detecting anomalies within \acrshort{das} data}. With our autoencoder based approach, we're able to effectively detecting anomalies within \acrshort{das} data. With even bigger datasets, and more image labeling of \acrshort{das} data, we believe one can achieve even greater results. \\

\textbf{G2: Contribute to the open source community, particularly with tools and resources that are beneficial to members of \acrshort{cgf}.} Throughout our work, we've always maintained a strong stance on developing tools that are both beneficial and easy to use. We firmly believe that both of our tools can be of use, specifically for members at \acrshort{cgf}.  \\ 

\textbf{G3: Determine whether Julia is a suitable programming language for 
 high performance data processing, analysis and \acrshort{ai}, specifically aimed at \acrshort{das} data}. Overall, we find Julia satisfactory in developing novel, high performance algorithms, as well as working with data science in general, yet lacking when it comes to training \acrshort{ai} models across multiple \acrshort{gpu}s. We believe it to be an effective language of choice for members at \acrshort{cgf}.\\
