Anomaly detection has a wide range of use cases these days. From network traffic, to stock forecasting, the options are endless. 
Signal processing deals with a pletora of unorganized data, where one often want to see . This has traditionally b. 
This field has started to see lots of applications appear. Fiber optic cables has become increasingly more popular due to how \acrshort{das} works in tangent with them, due to its high sensitivity. Applying anomaly detection algorithms to these kinds of data could potentially help us detect unwanted objects or creatures automatically on real-time data, reducing time spent on manual intervention. It can also be applied in before algorithms to remove these kinds of data from the original data. \\

We present \texttt{JudasNET}, a model for performing anomaly detection on DAS data. Additionally, we propose a package written in Julia, for pre-processing DAS files \cite{projthesis} and functionality for both training and inference mode on these models. We validate our model on real world data received from \acrfull{cgf}.   \\
