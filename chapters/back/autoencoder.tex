\subsection{Autoencoder}

The autoencoder is a type of network used to learn efficient encodings of unlabeled data. 

Autoencoders are split into two parts. The encoder $E_\phi$ and the decoder $D_\theta$. The relationship between these can be articulated as such: 

\begin{equation}
E_\phi: X \rightarrow Z 
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
D_\theta: Z \rightarrow X
\end{equation}


Typical usecases for autoencoders are signal analysis, anomaly detection, reconstructing images and so on. 
One of the more well known usages for autoencoders

\subsubsection{LSTM Auto Encoder}

As we've discussed in \ref{ai:lstm} and \ref{ai:rnn}, these types of networks are well suited for . The issues found with \acrshort{rnn}s, such as long term dependencies, are solved with using \acrshort{lstm}s, and also initializing the weights in a more intelligent way. We are not going to make use of transfer learning for our network, thus we solely rely on \acrshort{lstm}s to solve these issues.

Combining the \acrshort{lstm} with an autoencoder approach, we'll be able to create a network well suited for anomaly detection on variable time series data.
