\subsection{Autoencoder}

The autoencoder is a type of network used to learn efficient encodings of unlabeled data. 

Autoencoders are split into two parts. The encoder $E_\phi$ and the decoder $D_\theta$. The relationship between these can be articulated as such: 

\begin{equation}
E_\phi: X \rightarrow Z 
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
D_\theta: Z \rightarrow X
\end{equation}


Typical usecases for autoencoders are signal analysis, anomaly detection, reconstructing images and so on.
