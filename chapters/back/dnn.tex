% Deep Learning
\acrfull{dl} is a subset of \acrshort{ml} and \acrshort{ai}, where the objective is to learn underlying representations of data \cite{lecun2015deep}. In \acrshort{dnn}s, neurons act as the fundamental building blocks. Layers of neurons are grouped into three categories of layers: input-, output- and \textit{hidden layers}.

We mainly differentiate between three subcategories of \acrshort{dl}:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Supervised learning}: Data is labeled, and the goal of the network is trained to make sure the outputs match these labels.
    \item \textit{Unsupervised learning}: The network learns patterns exclusively from unlabeled data and tries to learn the underlying structure of the input vectors \cite{KARHUNEN2015125}. 
    \item \textit{Semi-supervised learning}: Some data may be labeled
\end{itemize}
