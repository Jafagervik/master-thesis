\section{Unsupervised Deep Learning}

% Deep Learning
Deep learning is a subset of ml and ai, where the models try to process information like the human mind CITE. Since its' beginnings in 1950s with MLPs, deep learning. \\

% Unsupervised Deep Learning
Unsupervised deep learning refers to algorithms that learns patterns exlusively from unlabeld data, compared to their supervised alternatives. These algorithms aims at learning the underlying structure of the input vectors \cite{KARHUNEN2015125}. \\

Deep neural networks work on a layer to layer basis. MORE. \\
