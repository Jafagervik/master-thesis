% Unsupervised Deep Learning
Unsupervised deep learning refers to algorithms that learn patterns exclusively from unlabeled data, compared to their supervised alternatives. These algorithms aim at learning the underlying structure of the input vectors \cite{KARHUNEN2015125}. \\

Deep neural networks work on a layer to layer basis. MORE. \\
