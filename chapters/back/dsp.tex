\subsection{Distributed Acoustic Sensing}
\label{back:das}

\acrfull{das} is a type of sensing technology that uses fiber optic cables to measure strain and vibrations along their length. By employing specialized optoelectronic devices, such as the OptoDAS \cite{asn_optodas}, \acrshort{das} systems can detect and measure acoustic disturbances with high spatial and temporal resolution over distances up to 70-80km. This technology is widely used for monitoring conditions within geophysical environments. Some of the use cases of \acrshort{das} at \acrshort{cgf} include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Movement of traffic
    \item Detection of landslides
    \item Whale monitoring outside Svalbard
    \item General seismic activity detection
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Gauge length} is the spatial resolution of measurements

\textbf{Channel distance} stores information on spatial sampling. Not all channels along the total measurement are stored, so to understand the location of a signal, the gauge length, combined with the channel distance, tells us the exact distance from the start of the measurement.

\textbf{Sample Rate} is the temporal resolution of the data and is measured in hertz. \\

\acrshort{das} data can be seen as a multi-channel time series, where each channel (sensor) stores signal values for different sample times.   \acrshort{das} data can be stored in different file formats, but due to the hierarchical nature of the data, formats such as TDMS \cite{10.1145/800196.805973} or \acrshort{hdf5} are commonly used. Their hierarchical nature is ideal for complex datasets, which often require additional metadata. Regardless of the chosen format, certain metadata are crucial for effectively handling and interpreting \acrshort{das} signal data:
The \textit{spatio-temporal} aspects of \acrshort{das} come from how the data is represented. This data can be represented as a one-channel image, as shown by the seismic heatmap in Figure \ref{fig:dasframe-ex}.

\begin{table}[!h]
\centering
\begin{equation*}
\mathbf{X} = \begin{bmatrix}
x_{1,1} & x_{1,2} & \cdots & x_{1,n-1} & x_{1,n} \\
x_{2,1} & x_{2,2} & \cdots & x_{2,n-1} & x_{2,n} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots & \vdots \\
x_{t-1,1} & x_{t-1,2} & \cdots & x_{t-1,n-1} & x_{t-1,n} \\
x_{t,1} & x_{t,2} & \cdots & x_{t,n-1} & x_{t,n}
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}
\label{fig:dasmatrix}
\end{table}

In the matrix $\textbf{X}$ above, $t$ denotes the number of recordings for the file; for one second this would be equal to the sample rate. $n$ is the amount of channels stored. To process this data as fast as possible, it is important to consider which memory alignment the programming language of choice uses. In Julia, MatLab and Fortran, memory is stored in column-major order, while in most other languages, memory is stored in a row-major order.

\subsection{Radio Frequency Filtering}

\acrfull{rf} filtering is of paramount importance in \acrshort{das} and \acrfull{dsp}. The signal quality can be improved by removing unnecessary noise from the data, and can decrease the overall of signal loss. In general, there are four types of filters, and can be defined as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Band-pass filters} only allows frequencies between two cutoff frequencies $F_{low}$ and $F_{high}$
    \item \textit{Band-stop filters} stops frequencies between two cutoff frequencies $F_{low}$ and $F_{high}$
    \item \textit{Low-pass filters} only allows frequencies above the cut-off frequency $F_{low}$
    \item \textit{High-pass filters} only allows frequencies above the selected frequency $F_{high}$
\end{itemize}

A common approach to preprocessing \acrshort{das} data usually involves applying a bandpass to the signal matrix. Due to \acrshort{das} data being sensitive and capturing a broad range of frequencies, it is beneficial to limit the signals to a range of interest, depending on domain and application.

\subsection{Tukey Window}
\label{dsp:tukey}

Window functions are function often used in \acrshort{dsp} to avoid artifacts. This is done by setting values outside a pre-defined interval to zero and applying a taper from the passband to the first zero value. The Tukey window \cite{tukey1967introduction}, also known as the \textit{cosine-tapered window} is a common approach to reduce edge effects, and is defined as follows:

\[
    w(x)= 
\begin{cases}
    \frac{1 + \cos{2 \pi \alpha (x + \frac{1-\alpha}{2})}}{2}, & \text{if } x \leq \frac{1-\alpha}{2}\\
    1,              & \text{if } \frac{\alpha}{2} < x \leq \frac{\alpha}{2}\\
    \frac{1 + \cos{2 \pi \alpha (x - \frac{1-\alpha}{2})}}{2}, & \text{if } x > \frac{1-\alpha}{2}
\end{cases}
\]

\subsection{Resampling}

''Resampling methods are statistical procedures that reuse the sample data for the purpose of statistical inference''\cite{https://doi.org/10.1002/widm.1054}. In many applications, data is often initially collected at a very high sampling rate to capture fine details. However, this high sampling rate is not computationally efficient or even necessary for all analytical purposes. Down-sampling, also referred to as decimation within the \acrshort{dsp} field, is a form of resampling where the sampling rate is reduced, can be applied to:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Decrease memory consumption for data storage
    \item Reduce computational time for data processing
    \item Balance the trade-off between processing efficiency and data resolution
\end{itemize}

By reducing the sampling rate, one may retain the essential characteristics of the data while reducing data volume and computational requirements. However, one must be careful to avoid aliasing and ensure that the resampled data accurately represents the phenomena of interest. For \acrshort{das} data, this can differ drastically from one experiment to another. 

\subsubsection{Parallel Channel Decimation}

\acrshort{das} data is a prime candidate for down-sampling due to its often high sampling rate. This operation is often referred to as \textit{channel decimation}. Channel decimation applies down-sampling on a per-channel level to decrease memory consumption. This operation can be deemed \textit{embarrasingly parallel} because each channel can be down-sampled independently. By introducing $P$ workers, each worker $P_i$ can down-sample a chunk of channels in parallel. Consequentially, the resulting outputs can be concatenated into a new matrix. This operation can be described as follows:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
a_{11} & a_{12} & \cdots & a_{1n} \\
a_{21} & a_{22} & \cdots & a_{2n} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
a_{m1} & a_{m2} & \cdots & a_{mn}
\end{bmatrix}
\]

\begin{center}
Resample each column in parallel
\end{center}

%\vspace{0.5cm}

\[
B = \begin{bmatrix}
b_{11} & b_{12} & \cdots & b_{1n} \\
b_{21} & b_{22} & \cdots & b_{2n} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
b_{h1} & b_{h2} & \cdots & b_{hn}
\end{bmatrix}
\]

In the equation above, $A$ is the input matrix of size $m \times n$.  $B$ is the resultant matrix, where $h$ is calculated as follows: 

$$h = m \times rate = m \times \dfrac{F_{target}}{F}$$

$m$ is the number of rows, which in the case of a \acrshort{das} signal where the channels are stored column-wise, can be defined by the sample frequency $F$ multiplied by the signal duration $dur$ in seconds.
