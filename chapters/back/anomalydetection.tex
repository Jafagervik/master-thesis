\section{Anomaly Detection}

Anomaly detection is the study of detecting anomalies in datasets. It is widely used in a plethora of fields, such as networking, medical informatics and more. 

For \acrshort{das} data specifically, anomaly detection can be used for detecting clusters of signals that don't correspond to the predispused target feature. Registering these outlier signals and receiving real time information about these could prove vital in some cases,  and in best case scenario save lives.
