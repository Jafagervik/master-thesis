\subsubsection{LSTM}

\acrfull{lstm} is an improved version of \acrshort{rnn}

An \acrshort{lstm} cell is built by 


Whereas \acrshort{rnn}s shines at \acrshort{nlp}, speech recognition, and media processing, \acrshort{lstm}s is vastly better for time series forecasting due to the memory gates. This makes \acrshort{lstm}s a suitable option for us when working with anomaly detection on sensor data, which in its essence is nothing more than more complex time series data across multiple columns or channels.
