\chapter{Related Work}
\label{chap:relwork}

In this chapter, we take a look at different methods used during the years for dealing with unsupervised anomaly detection. We'll start looking at traditional \acrlong{ml} methods, and move over to look at \textit{state-of-the-art} models for anomaly detection, both in one and two dimensions. \\


Anomaly detection, or outlier detection as it is often referred as, has gone through many iterations throughout the year, and been a stable problem to test different statistical and artificial models on. \\ 

As we mentioned in \ref{chap:back}, we differentiate between labled and unlabeled problems, and in this case, unsupervised, semi supervised and fully supervised algorithms.
