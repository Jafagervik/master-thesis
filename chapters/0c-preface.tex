\chapter*{Preface}

This master thesis was prepared during the spring of 2024 at the \acrfull{ntnu}, Faculty of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering, Department of Computer Science. The thesis was written and accomplished in cooperation with NTNU SFI Centre for Geophysical Forecasting. \\

This marks the end of a long journey. Through ups and downs I've made it to where I'm at today, writing these very words. I distinctly remember the day I entered university. I did not know what I'd like to focus on, given my various different interests within computing from the age of 14. I stand here now, trying to bridge the gap between HPC and AI, with this thesis as my weapon in this fight. \\

I want to give my sincerest thanks to my supervisor Ole Jakob Mengshoel for listening to my monologues and providing guidance thorughout this last year of my studies. Robin Rørstadbotnen for helping me get the necessary data and how to get started. Martin Landrø at \acrlong{cgf} for providing me with data and resources, and Helene for all clearance related stuff. Besides these people, I want to offer my gratitude towards my friends and family for always sticking by my side, no matter what life threw at me. Without them, I'd be lost on the path of life. \\

Last of all I want to thank my girlfriend, Ronja, the beacon of my heart for staying by my side through good and bad days throughout this semester and for always supporting me.\\

Finally, as I leave my final lasting remarks before I graduate, I can only think of a few wise words regarding the future.
