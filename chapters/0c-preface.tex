study. I didn't exactly know what aspect of computer science I wanted to study, so in the end, I forged my own path, trying to bridge the gap between HPC and AI. My goal with this work is to try to bridge multiple fields within computer science. \\

I want to give my sincerest thanks to my supervisor Ole Jakob Mengshoel for listening to my monologues and providing guidance thorughout this last year of my studies. Robin Rørstadbotnen for helping me get the necessary data and how to get started. aMartin Landrø at \acrlong{cgf} for providing me with data and resources, and Helene for all clearance related stuff. Besides these people, I want to offer my gratitude towards my friends and family for always sticking by my side, no matter what life threw at me. Without them, I'd be lost on the path of life. \\

Last of all I want to thank my girlfriend, Ronja, the beacon of my heart for staying by my side through good and bad days throughout this semester and for always supporting me. \\

Finally, as I leave my final lasting remarks before I graduate, I can only think of a few wise words regarding the future.
