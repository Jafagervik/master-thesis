\chapter*{Preface}

The beginning of the end. Six years have gone since I started university to pursue my passion. Little did I know what this years would hold, all the friends and people I'd meet, and all the new information I'd learn. I want to reminisce a bit about my journey towards where I am today. \\

I have, for as long as I can remember, always had a deep fascination with computers and electronics. Not only did I play lots of video games growing up, I also picked up Python programming at the ripe age of 13. From that point on I continued to teach myself web- and game development, as well as some basic webscraping using Python. When I graduated high school, there was no doubt in my mind what I was going to study. I didn't exactly know what aspect of computer science I wanted to study, so in the end, I forged my own path, trying to bridge the gap between HPC and AI. My goal with this work is to try to bridge multiple fields within computer science. \\

I want to give my sincerest thanks to my supervisor Ole Jakob Mengshoel for listening to my monologues and providing guidance, Robin .. and Martin Landro at \acrlong{cgf} for providing me with data and resources, and Helene for all clearance related stuff. Besides these people, I want to offer my gratitude towards my friends and family for alwasys sticking by my side, no matter what life threw at me. Without them, I'd be lost on the path of life. \\

Last of all I want to thank my girlfriend, Ronja, the beacon of my heart for staying by my side through good and bad days throughout this semester and for always supporting me. \\

Finally, as I leave my final lasting remarks before I graduate, I can only think of a few wise words regarding the future.
