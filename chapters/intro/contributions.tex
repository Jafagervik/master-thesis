\section{Contributions}

Our work has led to to several contributions, most notably:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Judas} - A software package developed in Julia for processing \acrshort{das} data. Initially introduced in our project thesis \cite{projthesis}, Judas is now fully operational and available for use by members of the \acrshort{cgf}.
    \item \textbf{TinyDAS} -  An open-source package written in Python, specifically designed for training and evaluation of autoencoder models tailored for anomaly detection on \acrshort{das} data.
\end{itemize}
