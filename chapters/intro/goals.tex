\section{Goals}

From the very beginning, we know that our project is vast and have many different angles of incidences. Therefore we want to clarify what we will aim for with this specific work.
Our goals for this thesis are as following: 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Find out if Julia is a well suited language when it comes to big data, data science and \acrshort{ai}.
    \item What kinds of unsupervised models can work well with \acrshort{das} data.
    \item Make ou especially members at \acrshort{cgf}.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Research Questions}

In addition to our goals, the following are a set of questions we want answers to by the end of the article:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Are autoencoders well suited for anomaly detection of das data
    \item Can we make scalable das data for cgf
\end{enumerate}
