\section{Goals}

Given the vast scope and multiple facets of our project, it is important to clarify the specific objectives we aim to achieve with this thesis. Our goals are as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Assessing Autoencoders for Anomaly Detection in \acrshort{das} Data}: Evaluate the effectiveness of autoencoders in detecting anomalies within \acrshort{das} data.
    \item \textbf{Open Source Contributions for \acrshort{das}}: Contribute to the open-source community, particularly with tools and resources that are beneficial to members of \acrshort{cgf}.
    \item \textbf{Evaluating Julia for Big Data Science Applications}: Determine whether Julia is a suitable programming language for big data, data science and \acrshort{ai} applications?
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Research Questions}

In addition to our goals, the following are a set of research questions we want answers to by the end of the thesis:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Scalability and Parallelization in \acrshort{das} Data Processing}: Can we develop a program that is both scalable and parallelizable for processing and training large \acrshort{hdf5} files?
    \item \textbf{Float16 Processing on \acrshort{das} data}: Can we reduce the precision of \acrshort{das} data to enable faster model training and inference without sacrificing performance?
\end{enumerate}
