\section{Thesis outline}

The following list is an outline over the rest of the thesis, and what will be presented for each section. \\

\textbf{Chapter 1: Introduction} - We present the problems, what we want to find out and our motivation for this project. \\

\textbf{Chapter 2: Background and Theory} - We go more in dept about theory regarding both relevant \acrshort{dl} architectures and their applications to our problems, as well as some introduction to applicable signal processing techniques.  \\

\textbf{Chapter 3: Literature Review} - Here we discuss relevant literature, both on \acrshort{ai} for signal processing in general, but also around \acrshort{das} data. \\

\textbf{Chapter 4: Method} - We cover all our practical work, and implementation decisions. This includes data processing, \acrshort{api} design, network architecture and experiments. \\

\textbf{Chapter 5: Results and Discussions} - We present our findings, compare results, discuss different outcomes and about Julia in general. \\

\textbf{Chapter 6: Conclusion and Further Work} - This final chapter concludes our findings. We answer the questions asked in \textbf{Chapter 1}, and try to see where all this leaves us going forward. \\
