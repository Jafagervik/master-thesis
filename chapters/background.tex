\chapter{Background and Related Work}
\label{chap:back}

In this second chapter, we establish the theoretical foundation for our work, covering key concepts in signal processing, anomaly detection, and \acrshort{ai}. We explore relevant data processing techniques and examine previous research on anomaly detection and autoencoders, with a particular focus on methods applicable to \acrshort{das} data.
