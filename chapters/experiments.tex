\chapter{Experiments}
\label{chap:exp}

The fourth chapter presents our experiments and is split into two parts: one for \acrshort{das} processing and one for anomaly detection using autoencoders. Both follow a consistent structure: we begin with a detailed description of the dataset, followed by an explanation of the research methodologies. We then justify our choice of evaluation metrics and outline the experimental setups.
