\section{Experiment 1: BANENOR}


\subsection{Dataset}


Our first experiment revolves around a \acrshort{das} dataset on a a train route between Trondheim and Storen, and is owned by BANENOR. The dataset spans the entirety of the 31st of August 2021\footnote{Working with national infrastructure requires security clearance, see \ref{app:conf} for more details}. The full route between Trondheim and Storen can be seen in appendix \ref{app:judas}. All the data is stored in hdf5 files.

As we can see in table \ref{tab:experiment_data}, the total distance of this dataset is approximately 50km, where data from every 4th sensor across the route is stored. Each file contains 10 seconds of data, storing a $20000 \times 12500$ alongside relevant metadata, where each element is of type \texttt{Float32}, giving us a total of \qty{8}{\giga\byte} to be stored for every 10 seconds.  \\

\subsection{Evaluation}

In order to evaluate the improvements and additions to this package, we will be performing benchmarks both on individual functions, looking at the overall runtime of a realistic use-case.  
\paragraph{Parallel Resample function}We compare the parallel resampling method to a serial approach. Our input matrix will be a 5 minute DAS dataframe, with an effective ROI of [1:124:12499] giving an effective channel distance of \qty{200}{\si{\meter}}. The benchmark code can be found in.

\paragraph{Loading and Processing \acrshort{das} data}A full test from start to finish will be conducted. The experiment code can be found in \ref{app:judas}.

For both of these tests, speedups and parallel efficiency will be the main point of focus. We utilize different amounts of processes, and for the second benchmark, we compare


\subsection{Experiment Setup}

Due to national regulations, we will be performing all benchmarks on local servers belonging to \acrshort{cgf}. The system specifications can are all listed in the table below. \\
